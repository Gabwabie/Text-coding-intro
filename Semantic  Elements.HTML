                <h2>Facts About Dogs</h2>
                <p>
                    Your dog can smell your feelings. In fact, your dog's sense of smell is approximately 100,000 
                    times better than yours. So it shouldn't be shocking that they can in fact, smell things such as fear. 
                    When a human is fearful, they perspire, and a dog is easily able to pick up on this change.

                    The dog is a domesticated descendant of the wolf. Also called the domestic dog, it was domesticated 
                    from an extinct population of wolves during the Late Pleistocene, over 14,000 years ago by hunter-gatherers, 
                    prior to the development of agriculture. The dog was the first species to be domesticated by humans.
